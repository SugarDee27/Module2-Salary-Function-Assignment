# Module 2 Assignment — Salary Function

## 📌 Overview
This project processes employee salary data, performs lookups, handles errors, exports data to CSV, and integrates with R for further processing.  

The workflow includes:
1. Importing salary data from CSV.
2. Creating a Python function to search employee details.
3. Processing data with a dictionary for faster lookups.
4. Implementing error handling for invalid or missing inputs.
5. Exporting employee details to CSV inside a zipped folder.
6. Using R to unzip the folder and display the CSV contents.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Open the Notebook
In your terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook Salary_Function_Assignment.ipynb
```

### 2️⃣ Step-by-Step in the Notebook
- **Step 1:** Import `Total.csv`  
  Make sure `Total.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.  
- **Step 2 & 3:** Search for an employee:
  ```python
  get_employee_details_safe("EMPLOYEE NAME")
  ```
- **Step 5:** Export an employee profile:
  ```python
  export_employee_profile("EMPLOYEE NAME")
  ```
  This creates:
  - `Employee Profile/EMPLOYEE_NAME.csv`
  - `Employee_Profile.zip`

### 3️⃣ Step 6 — R Code in Jupyter
Run the following in an R cell:
```R
%%R
unzip("Employee_Profile.zip", exdir = "Unzipped_Employee_Profile")
employee_data <- read.csv("Unzipped_Employee_Profile/Employee Profile/EMPLOYEE_NAME.csv")
print(employee_data)
```

## 📝 Notes
- Replace `"EMPLOYEE NAME"` with an exact match from the dataset.
- Ensure R is installed and `rpy2` is configured before running R cells in Jupyter.
- Keep all files in the same directory for smooth execution.
